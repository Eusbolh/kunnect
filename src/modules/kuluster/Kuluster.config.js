      content: `I am in the middle of preparing for an interview and one of the problems can be easily solved through pattern matching.

      Here is the problem statement:
      
      Find the longest valid password: Given a string find the longest
      substring that forms a valid password. (A password is valid if it
      contains 1 Upper case char and it has no digit). For eg., if the given string is "aD0aclsdkf3lksD" then lksD is the largest valid password.
      
      Here is the regex expression that I am using to catch a password:
      
      .*[A-Z].*(^[0-9]+).*[A-Z]
      
      This does not work and so I was wondering if someone could give some hints as to how I should solve this problem. Thanks in advance!`,

      content: `The discovery of the USS Grayback prompted me to wonder: what happens to human remains in shipwrecked submarines?

      First, is it necessarily true that all compartments of a submarine flood if it wrecks? If so, I would assume normal ocean decomposition.
      
      If there are air pockets, what happens to the bodies of the crew in those compartments? Are the microbes we live with capable of consuming our entire bodies? Would they eat only soft tissue? Would the bodies mummify?`,
